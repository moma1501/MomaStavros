    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <hr>
    <ul>
        <li>3 egg whites</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt</li>
        <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon lemon juice</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <hr>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Line a sheet pan with parchment paper. 
            Draw a 9 inch circle on the parchment. An easy way to do this is to draw around the outside 
            of a 9 inch pan with a pencil</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, beat egg whites on high speed until soft peaks form. Add 3/4 cup of the sugar gradually, while continuing to whip. Make sure sugar is completely dissolved. 
                Mix together the remaining 1/4 cup sugar with the cornstarch; lightly fold into meringue with lemon juice.</li>
